# Sample-Demo

Detail Note : 

API (GET Methos): https://my-json-server.typicode.com/iranjith4/ad-assignment/db  

Instruction : 
a) From the API, display the list of facilities and its options by creating a UI, so that users
can select any one option from each facility. Display name and icon. For Example,
i) Property Type : Apartment, Condo, Boat House, Land - User can select only one
among this

b) Add the exclusion list by extending the above UI, so that users aren't able to select
from the exclusions combinations.
For example, users canâ€™t select these options together.
Ex. 1 : Property Type : Land, Number of Rooms: 1 to 3 rooms.
Ex. 2 : Property Type : Boat House, Other Facilities : Garage

c) Use Core Data to Persist the data, so every time you load data from the DB, and refresh
your DB from API once a day.
